# Digital Grader

Automated grading and security feedback for Java test-automation students.

## Current milestone

Sessions 4 and 5 are complete locally: teacher cohort/assignment APIs, validated ZIP uploads to MinIO, durable queue dispatch and submission status APIs now join the authentication backend. All 62 backend tests pass with disposable PostgreSQL, MinIO and RabbitMQ containers. Compose runs PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ and MinIO on dedicated loopback ports.

The approved React prototype remains unchanged: a teacher overview and split submission review, with sample-data student pages. UI/API integration, grading and AI remain future work. Real API uploads stay QUEUED until Session 6 adds a worker. See [Sessions 4–5](docs/SESSION_4_5.md) for endpoints, upload limits and delivery behavior, and [Session 3](docs/SESSION_3.md) for optional admin setup.

## Backend and infrastructure

Requires Docker with Compose v2, Java 17, Maven 3.9 and Python 3. From the repository root:

```sh
python3 scripts/init-dev-env.py   # once; preserves any existing .env
docker compose up -d --build --wait --wait-timeout 180
./scripts/backend.sh spring-boot:run
```

Then open http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/v1/health. Run `./scripts/backend.sh -B -ntp verify` for backend tests. See [Session 2 setup](docs/SESSION_2.md) for service ports, configuration, source-built MinIO, troubleshooting and stop/restart instructions. The first MinIO build can take several minutes. MinIO is a local compatibility dependency; upstream is archived, so production storage selection remains open.

## Run the frontend

Use Node.js 24 LTS (minimum 22.12) and npm.

```sh
cd frontend
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Open http://127.0.0.1:5176. The server binds to loopback and fails clearly if its port is occupied. The earlier Python preview is obsolete; it cannot serve React source files.

```sh
npm test          # component and submission lifecycle checks
npm run build    # strict TypeScript check plus production build
npm run preview  # preview the build at http://127.0.0.1:5175
```

All file selection is local. No ZIP bytes are uploaded or executed. Simulated submissions show the same labeled Java Fundamentals sample report, not an analysis of the selected project. Reloading discards local interaction state.

## Development workflow

Use short-lived feature branches and commits that represent coherent changes. Record meaningful decisions, run relevant checks, and keep the lockfile committed. Do not commit credentials, dependency folders, build output, or student submissions. CI is configured for frontend changes; a successful local run does not imply a GitHub Actions run has occurred.

The prototype keeps React 18. Patched Vite, Router, Vitest, and compatible TypeScript versions supersede the older build-spec versions; exact installed versions are pinned in package.json and package-lock.json. The visual design and Java/Spring target remain unchanged. Tailwind, charts and frontend API/authentication integration are deferred until needed for the next implementation slices.

## GitHub

Public repository: https://github.com/hamdamme/gradely. Session 1 is published on main and its frontend workflow passed. Session 2 was merged through PR #1 and its backend CI passed. Sessions 3–5 are verified locally on `session-4-5/teacher-submissions`; publishing/review and remote CI verification remain pending.

[Frontend Actions run verified at session start](https://github.com/hamdamme/gradely/actions/runs/37161397951).
